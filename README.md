# Workflow Execution Service backend

This project aims to fetch a workflow from a TRS-enabled [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu) instance,
fetch the inputs and workflow execution engine, and execute the workflow in a
secure way.

This development is relevant for projects like [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/) or [EJP-RD](https://www.ejprarediseases.org/).
