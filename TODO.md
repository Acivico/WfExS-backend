# TODO

- [x] **Step 0**: materialize Nextflow and CWL workflows from WorkflowHub. Downloading an RO-Crate using the TRS API of 
WorkflowHub to download the workflow.

- [ ] **Step 1**: materialize everything necessary to launch the workflows. Using a file that contains the ids or data 
references to the inputs that we are going to use to instantiate the workflows. For example: 
([wetlab2variations_execution.yaml](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/tree/main/tests/wetlab2variations_execution.yaml))

- [ ] **Step 2**: Launch the workflows in an execution environment.
